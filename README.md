# AgriSense

Welcome to the AgriSense GitHub repository! AgriSense is an online platform that provides data-driven decisions about crop planting and rotation, taking into account seasonal demand, weather conditions, and soil quality.  This repository contains the source code and development history of the AgriSense platform.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

backend: This directory contains the backend code of the AgriSense platform, including the API endpoints, MySQL database, and business logic implemented in Python.

frontend: Here, you will find the frontend code for the AgriSense platform, implemented using JavaScript and React. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

model: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models, gpt-3.5, used by AgriSense to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries, and they play a crucial role in solving specific problems.





### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the AgriSense platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement by allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

### How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

AgriSense leverages the openAI model to enhance the platform's functionality, particularly in providing crop suggestions based on answered prompts. The model has been fine-tuned to process and interpret the user's prompts. These models utilize cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing to generate accurate and meaningful responses to user prompts.

By incorporating Generative AI models into AgriSense, we enable users to answer prompts on their farm's condition, such as the altitude, annual rainfall, temperature, and soil type, and receive relevant crop suggestions. This significantly optimizes the farmer's profits, as users can obtain concise insights about the crops they can grow to meet seasonal demand. It provides data-driven tools and recommendations, making AgriSense a powerful platform for precise farming.
